M.S. Capstone 

Our capstone project considers the feasibilty and potential that vehicle-to-grid technology can have on shaving peak-loads and addressing the duck curve. We developed a method for quantifying the amount of energy that vehicle batteries could discharge back to the grid, considering factors such as battery size limitations, charger capabilities, electrical losses, expected vehicle availability, and participation rates.

Our capstone project was hosted by the Center for Community Energy: https://centerforcommunityenergy.org/
